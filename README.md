# Treehouse Database Project

## How to Run

From whichever directory contains the `Scheduler` folder, run

`flask --app Scheduler --debug run`

to start the server.

It will tell you where the app is running, just navigate there in a web browser.

Leave the `--debug` flag so that when an error happens the app doesn't die and we get comprehensive error messages
